# Catchem Data Warehousing, ETL, and Business Intelligence Project

## üìö Overview

Welcome to the Catchem Data Warehousing, ETL, and Business Intelligence project! This project focuses on building a comprehensive data warehousing solution, optimizing ETL processes, and implementing business intelligence tools. The project uses both SQL and NoSQL databases for efficient data storage and retrieval, and incorporates XSL, XML, and XSLT for data transformation and presentation.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing sample data and scripts for data ingestion.
- **`etl/`**: Directory containing ETL scripts and configurations written in Notepad++.
- **`warehouse/`**: Directory containing data warehouse schemas and optimization scripts.
- **`bi/`**: Directory containing business intelligence dashboards and reports.
- **`xml/`**: Directory containing XML data files and XSLT stylesheets for transforming XML data.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Notepad++
- An XSLT processor (e.g., Saxon, Xalan)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wk8481/DataWarehousing-and-Business-Analytics.git
   cd DataWarehousing-and-Business-Analytics
   ```

2. **Install the required libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up PostgreSQL**:
   - Install PostgreSQL and create a database.
   - Update the `etl/config.py` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

4. **Set up MongoDB**:
   - Install MongoDB and start the MongoDB server.
   - Update the `etl/config.py` file with your MongoDB connection details.

### Usage

1. **Run ETL processes**:
   - Navigate to the `etl/` directory and run the ETL scripts to extract, transform, and load data into the data warehouse.
   ```bash
   cd etl
   python run_etl.py
   ```

2. **Transform XML data with XSLT**:
   - Navigate to the `xml/` directory and use an XSLT processor to transform XML data using XSLT stylesheets.
   ```bash
   cd xml
   xsltproc transform.xslt data.xml -o transformed_data.xml
   ```

3. **Access Business Intelligence Dashboards**:
   - Navigate to the `bi/` directory and open the BI dashboards in your preferred BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI).

### Example

An example usage of the ETL process, transforming XML data, and accessing BI dashboards can be found in the respective directories.

## üìö How It Works

### Data Warehousing

The data warehouse is designed to store and manage large volumes of data from various sources efficiently. It uses PostgreSQL for structured data storage and MongoDB for unstructured data storage.

### ETL Processes

ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes are implemented using scripts written in Notepad++. These scripts handle data ingestion, transformation, and loading into the data warehouse. The ETL processes are optimized for performance and scalability.

### XML and XSLT

XML is used for data representation, and XSLT is used for transforming XML data into different formats. XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) is used for styling XML data. These technologies enable flexible data transformation and presentation.

### Business Intelligence

Business intelligence tools are used to create interactive dashboards and reports that provide insights into the data. These tools connect to the data warehouse and visualize key metrics and trends.
